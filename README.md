# Exploring World Events and Global CO2 Emissions

According to the The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, it
is "unequivocal" that, primarily by greenhhouse gas emissions, human
activity has caused global warming, leading to "widespread and rapid
changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and biosphere" with
"adverse impacts". (IPCC, 2023) This narrative visualization
explores the evolution of global CO2 (a greenhouse gas) emissions
and how emissions have been impacted by major world events.
